# Blog Type Thing

A spot to put thoughts, tutorials, and whatnot.  Especially whatnot.
Lots of that.

Technical type stuff;

* A [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
  [Quick-Start Guide](2019/03/virtualenv.basics.md)
* [Exercises and sites](2019/05/scripting.practice.md) to help skill-up in Python, Shell,
  and Perl

Odd and ends:

* Links to some good [Non-alcoholic Beer](personal.misc/na-beer.html)
* A few of my favorite [Audio Books](personal.misc/audio-books.html)
* How I [solve a Rubik's Cube](personal.misc/rubiks.html).  Far from the only way to do it,
  but it's the method I first learned and still use.
* My recipe for [Chili](recipes/chili.html).  Yum.
* My mom's recipe for [Twice Baked Potato Casserole](recipes/twice.baked.potato.casserole.md).  Yum again!
