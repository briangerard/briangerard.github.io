A spot to put thoughts, tutorials, and whatnot.  Especially whatnot.
Lots of that.

In no particular order, then:

* A [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
  [Quick-Start Guide](2019/03/virtualenv.basics.md)
* [Exercises and sites](2019/05/scripting.practice.md) to help skill-up in Python, Shell,
  and Perl
