# Non-Alcoholic Beer

A place for me to track non-alcoholic breweries and beers, maybe post some reviews, etc.

Kicking things off, the [Non-Alcoholic Beer Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb_JFQ1H3ktF_xG7fnmfbRQ)
is a great resource for reviews on these beers.  The host quit drinking for dry January in
2019 (I think), and found enough good N/A selections that he just stayed quit afterwards.
Now he posts reviews and gets ahold of some pretty rare selections sometimes as well. (What,
me jealous?)

I'll add some brief reviews here as I think of it.  For now, here's a list of the breweries
and beers I've found (and mostly have tried).
