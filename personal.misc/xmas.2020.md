# Christmas List 2020

## Just a Convenient Spot to Put This

### Puzzles

I've seen a good number of these at Barnes and Noble, but their site sucks.  So I'm
linking to Amazon just for reference/convenience.

In general what I'm after here are visually attractive, challenging, cast metal puzzles.
The Hanayama puzzles are rated in difficulty from 1-6, with 6 being the most difficult.
I'd prefer level 4 or above, but I'm good with a lower level one if it's pretty enough.

In no particular order...

- [Hanayama "Equa"](https://www.amazon.com/Hanayama-Metal-Brain-Teaser-Puzzle/dp/B0038BE94Q)
- [Hanayama "Marble"](https://www.amazon.com/MARBLE-Hanayama-Metal-Teaser-Puzzle/dp/B018RC3AZO)
- [Hanayama "Infinity"](https://www.amazon.com/INFINITY-Hanayama-Difficulty-Velveteen-Drawstring/dp/B071R62ZXH)
- [Hanayama "Twist"](https://www.amazon.com/TWIST-Hanayama-Metal-Teaser-Puzzle/dp/B00KDGX4CM)
- [Hanayama "Coil" and "O'Gear"](https://www.amazon.com/MARCOPOLO-Value-Hanayama-Multipack-Puzzles/dp/B07P131RWS)

- [Hanayama "UFO"](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Cast-Hanayama-Puzzle-Pack/dp/B01H0S0428)

...and so on.  There are tons of them from Hanayama, and other companies as well.  I like
all of those listed above, but it's the style and difficulty I'm looking for.  So anything
along those lines would be welcome.
