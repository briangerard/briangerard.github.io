## Just a Convenient Spot to Put This

### Puzzles

I've seen a good number of these at Barnes and Noble, but their site sucks.  So I'm
linking to Amazon just for reference/convenience.

In general what I'm after here are visually attractive, challenging, cast metal puzzles.
The Hanayama puzzles are rated in difficulty from 1-6, with 6 being the most difficult.
I'd prefer level 4 or above, but I'm good with a lower level one if it's pretty enough.
