# Favorite Audio Books

These are some audio books I've listened to and enjoyed immensely.  I do so significantly less often now
that I work full time remotely, but I'll still treat myself to one when I travel.

I'm going to start with a sort of thematic breakdown.

One thing to note is that I typically only listen to non-fiction audio books.  For whatever reason, I
prefer reading fiction dead-tree style.

## Motivation, Professional Development

- [100 Ways to Create Wealth](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Create-Wealth-Steve-Chandler/dp/1931741786), Steve Chandler and Sam Beckford
  - This was one of the first personal development audio books I read, and it's still one of my
    favorites.  Steve is very down-to-earth and witty in this, while still giving some great advice
    for succeeding in business and life.  Read by Steve himself.
- [Time Warrior](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Warrior-procrastination-people-pleasing-over-commitment/dp/1600250378), Steve Chandler
  - Another good one from Steve Chandler.  Similar style, but he gets a little more... how to say
    it... abstract?  In parts of it, anyway.  Still a lot of good practical advice, and an enjoyable
    listen.  Not read by Steve, unfortunately.
- [Influencer, The Power to Change Anything](https://www.amazon.com/Influencer-Science-Leading-Change-Second/dp/0071808868), Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, et al.
  - This is a great exploration of how to influence change in your life, the lives of those around
    you, and in the world.  It outlines the authors' decades-long study of successful change agents
    who have created vast, lasting changes in our world.  They examined what they did and what they
    had in common, and then codified it and boiled it down to only six things that need to be used
    in order to make changes that last.  Read by one of the authors.
- [Change Anything, The New Science of Personal Success](https://www.amazon.com/Change-Anything-Science-Personal-Success/dp/0446573906), Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, et al.
  - The successor to Influencer, this one is more geared toward making change in your own life,
    rather than influencing others.  It's built around the same six principles that drive successful
    change in Influencer, just aimed more towards the individual.  That being said, I would
    recommend starting with Influencer and then moving on to Change Anything.  I feel that getting
    the grounding in Influencer helped me understand and better mentally frame the material in
    Change Anything.  Not read by an author this time.
- [How To Become CEO](https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-CEO-Rising-Organization/dp/0786864370), Jeffrey J. Fox
  - So this is one I picked up from a used bookstore because it's all they had at the time and I
    needed my fix (I strongly recommend having one or two spare audio books close to hand to avoid
    such a horror).  Despite that, I did find this one useful.  It's not just about becoming CEO.
    This is really for anyone who wants to be more of a leader in their own life, personally or
    professionally.  It's a set of 75 "rules" that he lays out; both things to do and things to
    avoid in order to be more successful.  I really liked some of the principles he lays out.  Read
    by the author.

## Biography

- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Youre-Joking-Mr-Feynman/dp/0393355624), Richard P. Feynman
  - Richard Feynman's autobiographical memoir.  Aside from being a Nobel prize-winning theoretical
    physicist and contributor to the Manhattan Project, he was well known for being a rather
    eccentric and wild individual.  Well worth the listen!  Not read by the author.
- [Hitch 22, A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Hitch-22-Memoir-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/044654034X), Christopher Hitchens
  - Sam Harris was once slated to speak at an event with Christopher Hitchens and was concerned that
    it might be a bit boring.  His wife consoled him by telling him, "Nothing Hitchens does is ever
    boring."  Christopher Hitchens was a noted polemicist, writer, and reporter, an outspoken
    atheist, a truly fierce debater, and a phenomenal speaker.  He was, over time, a citizen of the
    U.K. and the U.S., a staunch leftist (some mix of communist and socialist), and eventually a
    conservative.  He led a fascinating life, and it's quite the experience to hear him tell it.
    Thankfully read by the author.
- [The Age of Turbulence](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Turbulence-Adventures-New-World/dp/0143114166), Alan Greenspan
  - Not strictly a biography of Alan Greenspan, but it was autobiographical with respect to his role
    in the world of modern finance.  This really gives an interesting perspective on some of the
    inner workings of the economic system as it is viewed from the top, and from deeply within it.
    It includes Greenspan's perspective on all of the presidents who he personally knew and worked
    with throughout his tenure on Capital Hill.  Really interesting!  Not ready by the author.

## Skill Building

- [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563), David Allen
  - NOTE: This looks like it may be a more recent revision of the book than the one I've heard.
  - This is the outline of the "Getting Things Done" (or "GTD") system of productivity.  This is one
    of the most practically useful audiobooks I've ever listened to.  Even though the material in
    the version I heard was a bit dated (it was largely written before electronic storage and file
    management was widespread), the principles REALLY helped me get some of my "mental clutter"
    under control.  Strongly recommended.  Read by the author.

## Informative

- [The World is Curved](https://www.amazon.com/World-Curved-Hidden-Dangers-Economy/dp/1591842182), David M. Smick
  - NOTE: It has been *years* since I've listened to this one, so the specifics are a bit fuzzy.
  - I recall this book really giving me a good overview of globalization and macroeconomics.  I'm
    afraid I don't remember a lot of details here, other than a favorable impression.  Not read by
    the author.
- [Super Crunchers](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Crunchers-Thinking-Numbers-Smart/dp/0553384732), Ian Ayres
  - NOTE: Same as above.  It has been *years* since I've listened to this one, so the specifics
    are a bit fuzzy.
  - An interesting overview of what data mining and machine learning can do.  Again, don't recall a
    lot of details here, other than that it was an enjoyable and educational listen.  Not read by
    the author.
