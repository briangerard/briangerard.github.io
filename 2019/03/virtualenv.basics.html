<h2>What's A Virtual Environment?</h2>

<div>A virtual environment is a way to have an "enclosed" environment in which to do Python
development without affecting the system as a whole, or other virtual environments.  In
practical terms, that means that a virtual environment has its own python executable and
modules installed.  When you're using a virtual environment, you can use 'pip' (or 'pip3')
to install a Python library without having to be root to do so.</div>

<h2>How To Set It Up</h2>

Installing virtualenv is relatively simple.

For Debian-based systems:

<pre>
$ sudo apt install virtualenv
</pre>

Or, using pip:

<pre>
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
</pre>
