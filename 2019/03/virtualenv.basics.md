# Getting Started With Virtualenvs

## What's A Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is a way to have an "enclosed" environment in which to do Python
development without affecting the system as a whole, or other virtual environments.  In
practical terms, that means that a virtual environment has its own python executable and
modules installed.  When you're using a virtual environment, you can use 'pip' (or 'pip3')
to install a Python library without having to be root to do so.

## How To Set It Up

Installing virtualenv is relatively simple.

For Debian-based systems:

```bash
$ sudo apt install virtualenv
```

Or, using pip:

```bash
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```
