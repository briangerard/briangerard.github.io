# Brian's Chili

Based on a combination of
[Boilermaker Tailgate Chili](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/78299/boilermaker-tailgate-chili/)
and [Chili I](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16276/chili-i/) from
[All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/), tweaked from there.

## Spices

 *  1/4-1/2 Cup Cumin
 *  1/4 Cup Chili Powder
 *  2 Tsp Hot Pepper Sauce (e.g. - Cholula)
 *  1 Tbsp Worcestershirt Sauce
 *  1 Tsp Salt
 *  1 Tsp Black Pepper
 *  1 Tbsp Dried Oregano
 *  1 Tsp Dried Basil
 *  1 Tsp Paprika
 *  1 Tsp Ground Coriander
 *  1 Tsp Cayenne Pepper
 *  1 Tbsp Minced Garlic
 *  1 Tbsp Brown Sugar
 *  1 Tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa

## Ingredients

 * 1 Lb Ground Chuck
 * 3/4 Lb Mild (NOT sweet) Italian Sausage
 * 1/4 Lb Hot Italian Sausage
 * 1 Lb Steak, cubed small (any kind; ribeye works great)
 * 3 15-oz Cans Chili Beans, drained (I use 1 pinto, 1 red, and 1 kidney)
 * 1 15-oz Can Chili Beans in Spicy Sauce (I use 1/2 Pinto and 1/2 Kidney when available)
 * 2 14.5-oz Cans Peeled and Diced Tomatoes w/juice
 * 1 6-oz Can Tomato Paste
 * 2 Yellow Onions, chopped
 * 3 Stalks Celery, chopped
 * 1 Green Bell Pepper, seeded and chopped
 * 1 Red Bell Pepper, seeded and chopped
 * 2 Green Chili Peppers, seeded and chopped (I generally use serrano)
 * 1 Cup Chocolate Stout (Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout works, but any quality chocolate
   stout should work.  If you can find it, Westbrook Brewing's Mexican Coffee Cake Imperial Stout
   is outstanding.)
 * 1 Cup Strong Brewed Coffee (dark roast is best, but medium is fine if you can't get dark)
 * 1 Tbsp Bacon Bits
 * 4 Cubes Beef Bouillon (or 4 Tsp Better Than Bouillon Beef)

### Optional

 * Kraft Macaroni and Cheese
 * Shredded Cheddar Cheese
 * Sour Cream

## Steps

  1. Chop all veggies, cube the steak, and remove the sausage from its casings.
  1. Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat.  Crumble the ground chuck and sausage into
     the pan, and add the cubed steak.  Cook until evenly brown.  Drain off excess grease.
  1. Pour in ALL other ingredients and spices, stirring to blend as you go.
  1. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally.
  1. After an hour or so, taste and adjust spices as necessary.
  1. After simmering occasionally stirring for at least 2 hours, remove from heat and serve,
     or refrigerate and serve the next day.
  1. To serve, ladle into bowls.
     1. Optional: Top with shredded cheddar cheese and/or sour cream.
     1. Optional: For Chili Mac, start with 1/3 bowl Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and fill the
        remaining 2/3 bowl with chili.
